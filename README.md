    The landing page is located inside the folder Week 02:
    - Inside assets you can find the icons used.
    - So far, the html index with the basic structure of the landing page, which will serve as the basis of the site.
    - Made with a side navigation bar, header, media information, and contact form.
    - To visualize what has been done of the landing so far, open the index.html in the browser. Or view its code by opening it with the text editor.
