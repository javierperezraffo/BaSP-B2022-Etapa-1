    Week 02:
    - We worked as agreed by creating a root folder with the name "BaSP-B2022-Stage1".
    - Inside we can find the folder "assets", which contains the resources used for the site.
    - So far, html with the basic structure of the landig, which will serve as the basis of the site.
    - Made with a side navigation bar, the header, the media information, and the contact form for requesting information.
    - To visualize what has been made of the landing so far, open the index.html in the browser.
    Week 03:
    - We worked on the basis of what was elaborated in week 02, making the pertinent corrections for a correct and conscientious structure of the site.
    -This week we created the CSS folder, which until now contains the styles.CSS and reset.CSS files.
    - In the styles.CSS we can visualize all the styles used for the landing.
    - The reset.CSS file serves us for the reset of the display function for older browsers.
