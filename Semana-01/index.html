        <h2>How GigaTech was born</h2>
        <p>
            In 2021, a journey began in Montevideo, Uruguay. Fulanito Mengano Rodriguez, our beloved CEO and founder of
            the company, noticed the business he worked for could use some help and started giving out Excel sheets to
            his fellow teammates in order to manage their teams efficiently. Eventually, it became a business idea on
            its own.
            Since then, we have been striving to help improve  our customers productivity rates, branching out into
            software solutions of all kinds. Our patented strategies and diversity of layout sheets have enabled us to
            reach over 150 companies in the span of only 6 months, granting us the title of Fastest Growing Company
            of 2022 in the Trackathon Awards for companies in the field of Logistics.
